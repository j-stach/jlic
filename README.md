# jlic

This tool can be used to automatically generate a simple GPL-Proprietary dual license for a Rust project. <br>
View the license template at [template.md](./src/template.md). <br>


### How to use
Install [jlic](https://crates.io/crate/jlic) by running `cargo install jlic`. <br>

To generate a license, `cd` into your Rust project and run `jlic`. <br>

Run `jlic --help` to view available options. <br>

***Note:** For now I advise you to manually change the license information in Cargo.toml instead of using the `-c` or `--update` flags.
Updating package information through `jlic -c` produces valid TOML but results in a loss of the file's original organization. 
(See [Cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml).)* <br>

### Troubleshooting
Please ensure that your Rust project is structured correctly and that you are running this script from within the project directory.
If your project builds with `cargo build` then you should not run into trouble using `jlic`. <br>
If you still encounter errors, please report the issue on the [github repository](https://github.com/j-stach/jlic)! <br>
